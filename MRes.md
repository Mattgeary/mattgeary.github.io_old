<br>

Please see the descriptions below for more information

<br>

Our MRes programme falls under the umbrella title of [MRes in Biological
Sciences](http://www.chester.ac.uk/biological-sciences/research/MRes-programmes). The
course consists of two taught modules completed in the first term
followed by extended research project for the rest of the course.
Students are expected to have contacted a potential supervisor and
agreed this project prior to applying for the course. The tuition fees
currently stand at £4126 for the MRes programme. The successful
applicant would also be responsible for their accommodation and living
costs. For both of the projects detailed below assistance will be
provided with fieldwork and equipment costs where possible. For more
information about either of these projects please contact Dr Matt Geary
(<M.Geary@Chester.ac.uk>). A wider range of projects are available as
part of the MRes, please contact Dr Matt Hartley
(<M.Hartley@Chester.ac.uk>) for a full list of the wildlife behaviour
and conservation projects available.

The global conservation status and threats to rails (Rallidae)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
_w/ Dr Alex Bond (RSPB) & Dr Auriel Fournier (Mississippi State University)_

Rails, coots, and gallinules (family Rallidae) are an understudied group of nearly 150 globally distributed species. Despite Rallidae's global distribution, many species are secretive and poorly studied, and while many species have large geographic ranges, many are single-island endemics, resulting in very different potential threats to each group's populations. Over 30 species have gone extinct in the last 500 years, and 35 are globally threatened on the IUCN Red List.  This project will evaluate the global conservation status of Rallidae, and synthesize the threats to populations, following similar work done for seabirds (Croxall et al. 2012. Bird Conservation International 22:1-34), including synthesizing their Red List Index, geographic areas of high endemism, common conservation themes among species, while highlighting research gaps and priorities. The student will also work closely with Dr Alex Bond (RSPB Centre for Conservation Science; https://alexanderbond.org/) and Dr Auriel Fournier (Mississippi State University; https://aurielfournier.github.io/), and with staff of Birdlife International, the Red List Authority for birds.

Conservation of critically endangered ibis species  
-----------------------------------------------------  
_w/ Wildlife Conservation Society & Dr Matt Hartley_  
  
Northern Cambodia is home to important populations of the critically endangered Giant Ibis (_Thaumatibis gigantea_) and White-shouldered Ibis(_Pseudibis davisoni_). These species are the focus of a nest protection and monitoring programme run by the Wildlife Conservation Society. They is also regularly caught on a network of camera traps used to monitor rare ungulate species in the region. This project will use these two data sources in combination along with data on habitats, landscape features and land use change to investigate, population trends, habitat preferences and breeding ecology of this threatened species. In particular the project will investigate drivers of population change and the importance specific features of forest pools for these species. The region is also home to several other threatened bird species which and the project may expand to include some of these where possible. This project is desk-based and would suit a student with good analytical and GIS skills who is interested in bird conservation.

Highland White-Faced Darter Dragonfly Ecology
------------------------------------------------
_w/ Dr. Achaz von Hardenberg_  

White-faced darter (_Leucorrhinia dubia_) are a habitat-specialist dragonfly which is currently classified as endangered on the British Red Data list. They are patchily distributed in Britain with the largest populations in the Scottish Highlands. Previous projects at the university of Chester have established a monitoring protocol to survey each life-stage of the white-faced darter. This project would use this protocol to monitor white-faced darter across several sights in the Scottish Highlands. The project will investigate differences in ecology, demographics and habitat preference across sites and provide information which will contribute to white-faced darter conservation at current sites as well as allow future surveys to better target suitable sites which are currently overlooked. This project will involve fieldwork in the Highlands of Scotland and students should be expected to be based there during the field season. This project would suit a student who is keen to work in the field. It will require good networking skills and the ability to work independently.

Pond colonisation on the Black Isle
------------------------------------------------
_w/ Scottish Natural Heritage and Dr. Lottie Hosie_  

Ponds are a specialist habitat which have been lost across large areas of Great Britain during the last century. This has led to the creation of ponds as an example of conservation management in many areas. The ultimate objective of such pond creation efforts may be to benefit particular target species such as great crested newt (_Triturus cristatus_), however, they also provide habitat, both transient and permanent for a range of other species. This project will use biodiversity assessments of newly created ponds on the Black Isle, Scottish Highlands, spanning a range of ages. The project will investigate changes in species richness and diversity over time as well as habitat features associated with particular taxa. This project will involve fieldwork in the Highlands of Scotland and students should be expected to be based there during the field season. This project would suit a student who is keen to work in the field. It will require good networking skills and the ability to work independently.

Great Crested Newt occupancy on the Black Isle
------------------------------------------------
_w/ Scottish Natural Heritage and Dr. Lottie Hosie_  

The Great Crested Newt (_Triturus cristatus_; GCN) is a UK Biodiversity Action Plan Priority Species which is protected by both UK and European legislation. Their biphasic lifestyle makes considerable use of terrestrial habitat surrounding their breeding ponds, but we know very little about this aspect of their lives. In contrast there is often extensive data, collected by enthusiastic volunteer surveyors, showing pond occupancy by the species during the breeding season. Combining such field data and modelling approaches can usefully inform management of GCN populations.Indeed, modelling methods have revealed the importance in this population of the surrounding woodland to newts (Miró _et al._ 2017) One particularly promising area of research is the use of occupancy modelling methods to investigate relationships between amphibian presence /abundance and variables related to habitats and management practices (e.g. Peterman et al, 2013). Not only can these models allow us to improve our understanding of GCN ecology but they can also be used to provide evidence for beneficial management actions for GCN conservation. Output from occupancy models can also help improve efficiency and accuracy of volunteer GCN surveys  and the value of this will be assessed. The project will concentrate on a population of GCN on the Black Isle, Scottish Highlands which, due to their relative isolation, provides an interesting situation to investigate pond-specific preferences and relationships with habitat features.

Using atlas data to estimate bird density and occupancy
------------------------------------------------
_w/ Dr. Achaz von Hardenberg_  

Bird atlases represent a huge undertaking which relies largely on the efforts of deeply committed amateurs around the country. These atlases, plus the survey work which informs them, represents an extremely useful source of information about bird distributions. This project aims to use the North Wales Bird Atlas as the basis for adding value to the bird atlas as a scientific resource. The project will make use of both the atlas data itself along with data from the various surveys which contributed to the atlas. The project will use modern statistical modelling approaches to estimate population density of key species in North Wales with regards to habitat as well as occupancy across the region. This project would suit a student with an interest in ornithology and innovative quantitative ecology methods.

Conservation genetics of Natterjack toads at Red Rocks
------------------------------------------------
_w/ Cheshire Wildlife Trust, Dr. Lottie Hosie and Dr. Anna Muir_  

Small, isolated populations are at high risk of local extinction due to loss of genetic variability and
associated reduction in fitness. Therefore, knowledge of population size and genetic diversity in
isolated populations is vital in order to prioritise conservation actions and recover populations that
are at risk. The natterjack toad (_Epidalea calamita_) is endangered and legally protected in Britain
and exists in less than 40 locations, making it of high conservation concern. One native natterjack
toad site lies on the edge of the Dee Estuary at Cheshire Wildlife Trust’s Red Rocks Nature Reserve. The historical population declined to extinction in the early 90’s and was reintroduced from a source population in North Merseyside However, due to the lack of suitable surrounding coastal dune habitat, the natterjack toad
population at Red Rocks is now thought to be completely isolated and concerns have been raised
that population numbers are low. Therefore, knowledge of population size and genetic diversity of
the natterjack toads at this site are vital to avoid a second local extinction event.
This project will involve collection of non-invasive samples in the field and will use conservation
genetic techniques, including microsatellite markers and genetic capture-recapture, to: 1) quantify
the number of individuals within the population; and 2) assess the genetic diversity of the
population. The results of this study will be used to form conservation recommendations with
Cheshire Wildlife Trust. The ideal candidate will have previous experience of laboratory work (including DNA extraction
and PCR) and access to a vehicle for fieldwork.

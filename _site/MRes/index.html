      <h1 id="mres-opportunities-with-dr-matt-geary-at-the-university-of-chester">MRes Opportunities with Dr Matt Geary at the University of Chester</h1>

<p>During the next academic year I have two research opportunities for
students who would be interested in undertaking a masters by research
degree programme.</p>

<p>Our MRes programme falls under the umbrella title of <a href="http://www.chester.ac.uk/postgraduate/applied-sciences-mres">MRes in Applied
Sciences</a>. The
course consists of two taught modules completed in the first term
followed by extended research project for the rest of the course.
Students are expected to have contacted a potential supervisor and
agreed this project prior to applying for the course. The tuition fees
currently stand at Â£4126 for the MRes programme. The successful
applicant would also be responsible for their accommodation and living
costs. For both of the projects detailed below assistance will be
provided with fieldwork and equipment costs where possible. For more
information about either of these projects please contact Dr Matt Geary
(<a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#077;&#046;&#071;&#101;&#097;&#114;&#121;&#064;&#067;&#104;&#101;&#115;&#116;&#101;&#114;&#046;&#097;&#099;&#046;&#117;&#107;">&#077;&#046;&#071;&#101;&#097;&#114;&#121;&#064;&#067;&#104;&#101;&#115;&#116;&#101;&#114;&#046;&#097;&#099;&#046;&#117;&#107;</a>). A wider range of projects are available as
part of the MRes, please contact Dr Matt Hartley
(<a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#077;&#046;&#072;&#097;&#114;&#116;&#108;&#101;&#121;&#064;&#067;&#104;&#101;&#115;&#116;&#101;&#114;&#046;&#097;&#099;&#046;&#117;&#107;">&#077;&#046;&#072;&#097;&#114;&#116;&#108;&#101;&#121;&#064;&#067;&#104;&#101;&#115;&#116;&#101;&#114;&#046;&#097;&#099;&#046;&#117;&#107;</a>) for a full list of the wildlife behaviour
and conservation projects available. //</p>

<h2 id="monitoring-the-white-faced-darter-leucorrhinia-dubia-reintroduction">Monitoring the White-Faced Darter (<em>Leucorrhinia dubia</em>) Reintroduction</h2>

<p>White-faced darter are a habitat-specialist dragonfly which is
currently classified as endangered on the British Red Data list. They
are patchily distributed in Britain with the largest populations in the
Scottish Highlands and locally concentrated populations in Shropshire
and Staffordshire. Reintroduction programmes have been undertaken to
replace lost populations in Cumbria and, more recently, Cheshire. Larvae
and eggs were initially reintroduced into Delamere forest Cheshire using
their natural Sphagnum habitat as a transportation medium. Since them,
further reintroductions have taken place along with monitoring and
habitat management to improve the wider landscape for White-faced
darter. Currently, monitoring efforts concentrate on exuviae counts
which are known to be one of the most effective methods for monitoring
Odonata populations. However, as the reintroduction progresses it
becomes important to assess the accuracy of exuviae monitoring as well
as to monitor the survival and movements of adult dragonflies.
Information on dispersal and the use of flight corridors and habitat
suitability assessments outside of the core reintroduction area would be
especially useful for future habitat management. This MRes project would
concentrate on these tasks and contribute to quantitative assessment of
the reintroduction programme. The project is in partnership with
Cheshire Wildlife Trust. This MRes project would be heavily fieldwork
based and require good networking skills.  //</p>

<h2 id="nest-protection-for-woodland-grouse">Nest protection for woodland grouse</h2>

<p>The nests of ground nesting birds are vulnerable to predation by
terrestrial mammals. In the case of capercaillie (<em>Tetrao urogallus</em>)
and black grouse (<em>Tetrao tetrix</em>), evidence indicates that foxes
(<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>) and pine martens (<em>Martes martes</em>) are the two most
significant mammalian predators. Pine martens are protected, but legal
culling of foxes to reduce their impact on grouse is sometimes carried
out. However, such management is expensive and raises ethical concerns.
In addition, removal of foxes may result in compensatory increases in
nest predation by martens. This MRes project would investigate the
development of non-lethal management techniques for protecting the nests
of capercaillie and black grouse. The project would involve field work
in the highlands of Scotland testing the effectiveness of a number of
nest protection techniques on protecting artificially constructed nests.
The project is in partnership with Forest Enterprise Scotland, who would
contribute to and support fieldwork equipment and costs. This project
would suit a student who is keen to work in the field. It will require
good networking skills and the ability to work independently.//</p>

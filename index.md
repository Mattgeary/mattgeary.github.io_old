I am a senior lecturer in Conservation Biology at the ![Matt](../images/photo.jpg){: .floatRight}{: height="500px" width="300px"} University of Chester (all views etc. expressed are my own) and work in the Conservation Biology Research Group. I'm an ecologist with an interest in how and why populations grow spatially and over time. Can these processes be explained through demographics, movements of individuals or, perhaps, environmental drivers? Why do certain species live where they do and how might this change in the future? I use ecological modelling and statistical analyses to try to answer these questions.   

<br>

My current research includes conservation projects on birds, amphibians and invertebrates as well as ecological projects on forest landscapes. In the past I have worked on black grouse conservation and vector-borne disease ecology. My [research outputs](http://mattgeary.github.io/output/) show some of the work I've been involved in before. I am an associate editor at []Bird Study](https://www.bto.org/research-data-services/publications/bird-study) and sit on the management board for the student research journal [Bioscience Horizons](https://academic.oup.com/biohorizons).

<br>

I am the programme leader for our [BSc (Hons) in Conservation Biology](http://www.chester.ac.uk/undergraduate/conservation-biology) at the [University of Chester](http://www.chester.ac.uk/departments/biological-sciences), teach on our [Animal Behaviour]() and [Biology]() programmes and I am also involved in out taught [MSc Wildlife Conservation](http://www.chester.ac.uk/postgraduate/wildlife-conservation) programme. 

<br>

I usually advertise several MRes projects each year as part of our [MRes Wildlife Conservation and Behaviour](https://www1.chester.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/biological-sciences-wildlife-behaviour-and-conservation-pathway/201810) programme. If you are interested, take a look at the [details of my projects](http://mattgeary.github.io/MRes/) which will, be posted when confirmed and contact me if you'd like to know more.

If you'd like to get in touch you can contact me at <M.Geary@Chester.ac.uk>.

I am also associated with [Stuart Marsden's Research group](http://stuartmarsden.blogspot.co.uk/) at MMU (where I did my PhD). Information about the conservation research going on there can be found on their blog.

### Matt Geary - Lecturer in Conservation Biology

  
<img class="right" src="images/photo.jpg" width="250" height="500" title="Matt Geary">
I am a lecturer in Conservation Biology / Animal Behaviour at the University of Chester (all views etc. expressed are my own) and am part of the Conservation Biology Research Group. I'm an ecologist with an interest in how and why populations grow spatially and over time. Can these processes be explained through demographics, movements of individuals or, perhaps, environmental drivers? Why do certain species live where they do and how might this change in the future? I use ecological modelling and statistical analyses to try to answer these questions.  

My current research includes conservation projects on birds, amphibians and invertebrates as well as ecological projects on forest landscapes. In the past I have worked on black grouse conservation and vector-borne disease ecology. My [research outputs](http://mattgeary.github.io/output.html) show some of the work I've been involved in before.  

I am the programme leader for our [BSc (Hons) in Conservation Biology](http://www.chester.ac.uk/undergraduate/conservation-biology) at the [University of Chester] and I am also involved in out taught [MSc Wildlife Conservation](http://www.chester.ac.uk/postgraduate/wildlife-conservation) programme.  

I am advertising two MRes projects in the coming year as part of our [MRes in Applied Sciences](http://www.chester.ac.uk/postgraduate/applied-sciences-mres). If you are interested, take a look at the [details of my projects](http://mattgeary.github.io/MRes.html) and contact me if you'd like to know more.   

If you'd like to get in touch you can contact me at <M.Geary@Chester.ac.uk>.

I am also associated with [Stuart Marsden's Research group](http://stuartmarsden.blogspot.co.uk/) at MMU (where I did my PhD). Information about the conservation research going on there can be found on their blog.
